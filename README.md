 - context holds the metadata info about the widgets more vitaly the position of the following widget on the screen or UI so to say.
 - save the input of user and diplay them
 - using the date picker functionality
 - using spacer() widget to make all the remaining space between widgets
 - using input controllers to save the input
 - Undo to deleted expense with the correct index of an entry
 - editing the whole app theme in one main.dart widget ( theme: ThemeData().copyWith(useMaterial3: true)  This will update only custom selected stylingg and use the default for the rest.
