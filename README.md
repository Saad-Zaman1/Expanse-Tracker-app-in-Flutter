This is the little advace project where I improved styling skills, Here are the following things that can be learnt in this project
 - third party packages(uuid package to generate new ids)
 - use enum to create custom type for catagories i.e enum Category { food, work }
 - use the listview.builder to display list more efficiently(its alternate of recyclerview in android dev)
 - use appBar widget to make customized tool bar according to our need( this widget are in Scaffold widget )
 - context holds the metadata info about the widgets more vitaly the position of the following widget on the screen or UI so to say.
 - save the input of user and diplay them
 - using the date picker functionality
 - using spacer() widget to make all the remaining space between widgets
 - using input controllers to save the input
 - Undo to deleted expense with the correct index of an entry
 - editing the whole app theme in one main.dart widget ( theme: ThemeData().copyWith(useMaterial3: true)  This will update only custom selected stylingg and use the default for the rest.
 - ElevatedButton.styleFrom() => this styleFrom also have the same behavior as copywith(In case of button theme styling)
